# 201

Used when a new resource has been created. 

According to the HTTP specification, this should contain a `Location` header pointing to the created resource. In general Nexmo APIs don't do this, instead opting to return the `GET` representation in the response

## Example response

```json
{
  "_links": {
    "self": {
      "href": "/accounts/7c9738e6/secrets/ad6dc56f-07b5-46e1-a527-85530e625800"
    }
  },
  "id": "ad6dc56f-07b5-46e1-a527-85530e625800",
  "created_at": "2017-03-02T16:34:49Z"
}
```
