# 202

Acknowledges the request has been received, but not that the process has been completed. Used for asynchronous tasks, such as if the action will be placed in a queue, or depends on an external service with a slow response time.

The response body should include status information and an identifier for the resource, such as a `self` link (some of our APIs return an ID here which is also acceptable).

## Example response

```json
{
  _links: {
    "self": "https://example.com/things/aaaaaaaa-bbbb-cccc-dddd-0123456789ab"
  }
  submitted_at: 2020-01-02T03:04:00+01:00
}
```
