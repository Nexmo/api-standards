# 202

Acknowledges the request has been received, but not that the process has been completed. Used for asynchronous tasks. Response body should include some kind of status, and a way to poll for status.  Should avoid this in favor of creating a 'workflow' resource for anything complex.

## Example response

> @TODO: Improve this example response

```json
{
  "status":"accepted"
}
```
