# 404

The resource could not be found, or the authenticating user does not have access to the resource.

We use `404` rather than `403` for invalid permissions as we don't want to leak that the resource exists to another user

## Example response

```json
{
  "type": "https://developer.nexmo.com/api-errors#invalid-api-key",

  "detail": "API key 'ABC123' does not exist, or you do not have access",
  "instance": "797a8f199c45014ab7b08bfe9cc1c12c"
}
```
