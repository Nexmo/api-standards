# 200

The `200` HTTP code is used when the user's request has been successful. This is our most commonly HTTP code and should be used for all successful requests, unless the request is a `POST` (see [201]({{< relref "http-code/200.md" >}})) or there are multiple status codes being returned (though this is discouraged, see [207]({{< relref "http-code/207.md" >}}))
