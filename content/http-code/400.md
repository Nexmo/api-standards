# 400

Generic, like a 200 used in most cases when the request is incorrect and no more specific code applies. More details should be available (specific error, and human description) in the response body.

## Example response

```json
{
  "type": "https://developer.nexmo.com/api-errors/account/secret-management#validation",
  "title": "Bad Request",
  "detail": "The request failed due to validation errors",
  "invalid_parameters": [
    {
      "name": "secret",
      "reason": "must contain 1 upper case character"
    }
  ],
  "instance": "797a8f199c45014ab7b08bfe9cc1c12c"
}
```
