When working with dates, our APIs will use consistent naming and formats.

Field names should be `[something]_at`. Examples include:

* `created_at`
* `started_at`
* `last_event_at`

The format will be [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) standard, for example: `2020-02-21T14:43:23+00:00` _or_ `2020-02-21T14:43:23Z`.

### Examples

```json
{
  "created_at": "2020-02-21T14:43:23+00:00"
}
```

### Why did we choose this?

Sugested and discussed in the #api-standards channel before adoption for future APIs.
