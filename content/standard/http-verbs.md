- `GET members/bob` - lists the details of bob who is a resources of the collection members
- `POST members -d '{"name": "Harry", "age": 22, "phone_number": "14155550100"}'` - create a new member called Harry
- `PUT members/harry -d '{"name": "Harry", "age": 23, "phone_number": "14155550100"}'` - replace all of Harry's details
