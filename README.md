# Nexmo API Standards

This is the source repo for Nexmo's API standards documentation. The standards themselves are still a work in progress, and can be [viewed online](https://nexmo.github.io/api-standards/)

## Contributing

If you notice an inaccuracy or a typo on this site, feel free to raise a pull request with a fix.

Unfortunately we do not accept contributions for new standards to this repository as our standards are defined internally by the product and engineering teams.
