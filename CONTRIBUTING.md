# Contributing to API Standards

If you notice an inaccuracy or a typo on this site, feel free to raise a pull request with a fix.

Unfortunately we do not accept external contributions for new standards to this repository as our standards are defined internally by the product and engineering teams. Internal users (from all departments) are very welcome to propose a Pull Request and/or discuss their suggestions on slack in `#api-standards`.
